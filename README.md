# Texture-Classification-using-Bag-of-Words-Model-and-SIFT-Features
This project classifies texture images from the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) using a Bag-of-Words model and SIFT features. We explore KNN, SVM, and AdaBoost classifiers, using Elbow and Silhouette methods to optimize KMeans clustering. Performance metrics and confusion matrices are included to highlight model accuracy.
